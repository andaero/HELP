template_v2 = """
### Basic Requirements:
- Identify and extract all the dynamic variables in each log with {placeholder} to create static log templates.
- Generalize the template beyond the provided examples, as logs in the same cluster likely have the same template.
- Seperate variables by spaces or colons
### Advices on parameters and non-parameters:
- Dynamic variables include: IP addresses, URLs, file paths, integers, directories, hexadecimal values, etc.
- Static elements: Error messages or interrupted messages are NOT dynamic parameters since they contain important information.
### Parameter Examples:
- `/var/www/html/` -> `{directory}`
- `192.168.0.1:8008` -> `{ip}`
- `blk_-123456783` -> `{blk_id}`
- `727 5302 1589 240` -> `{numbers}`
- `com.crash.wsf.error` -> `{error}
- `HTTP/0.1` -> `{protocol}`
- `true` -> `{boolean}`
### Output constraints:
- Provide a corresponding log template for each log line.
- Begin each log template with LogTemplate[idx], where idx is the index of the log.
- Do not provide any explanation or output that is not the template.
- Enclose each input log's template in backticks.
### Examples
Logs:
Log[1]: `Received block blk_-160899 of size 91178 from 10.250.10.6`
Log[2]: `Received block blk_-434451 of size 6710 from 10.250.15.8`
Log[3]: `Received block blk_783186 of size 6864 from 10.251.26.198`
Response:
<Inner monologue> All logs follow the same structure. They start with "Received block" followed by a block ID (blk_*), then "of size" and a number, and end with "from" and an IP address. The variable parts are the block ID, size, and IP address, which I've parameterized as {blk_id}, {size}, and {ip} respectively. </Inner monologue>
LogTemplate[1]: `Received block {blk_id} of size {size} from {ip}`
LogTemplate[2]: `Received block {blk_id} of size {size} from {ip}`
LogTemplate[3]: `Received block {blk_id} of size {size} from {ip}`

Logs:
Log[1]: `ciod: Message code 0 is not 51 or 42949##67295`
Log[2]: `ciod: Message code 0 is not 51 or 42949##67295`
Log[3]: `ciod: Message code 2 is not 3 or 42949##67295`
Log[4]: `ciod: Message code 0 is not 51 or 42949##67295`
Response:
<Inner monologue> These logs all have the same structure, starting with "ciod: Message code" followed by a number, then "is not" and another number, and ending with "or" and a large number. The variable parts are the two codes and the large number at the end. I've parameterized these as {code} for the first two numbers and {number} for the last one. Note that the second {code} could potentially be a different parameter if needed, but the current logs don't show a need for that distinction. </Inner monologue>
LogTemplate[1]: `ciod: Message code {code} is not {code} or {number}`
LogTemplate[2]: `ciod: Message code {code} is not {code} or {number}`
LogTemplate[3]: `ciod: Message code {code} is not {code} or {number}`
LogTemplate[4]: `ciod: Message code {code} is not {code} or {number}`

Logs:
Logs[1]: `external input interrupt (unit=0x02 bit=0x0b): y+ retransmission error was corrected`
Logs[2]: `external input interrupt (unit=0x02 bit=0x0a): x- retransmission error was corrected`
Logs[3]: `external input interrupt (unit=0x02 bit=0x0b): y+ retransmission error was corrected`
Logs[4]: `external input interrupt (unit=0x02 bit=0x0d): z+ retransmission error was corrected`
Response:
<Inner monologue> These logs all follow the same pattern. They start with "external input interrupt" followed by unit and bit values in parentheses, then "torus sender" followed by a direction (x-, y+, z+), and end with "retransmission error was corrected". The variable parts are the unit value, bit value, and direction, which I've parameterized as {unit}, {bit}, and {direction} respectively. </Inner monologue>
LogTemplate[1]: `external input interrupt (unit={unit} bit={bit}): {direction} retransmission error was corrected`
LogTemplate[2]: `external input interrupt (unit={unit} bit={bit}): {direction} retransmission error was corrected`
LogTemplate[3]: `external input interrupt (unit={unit} bit={bit}): {direction} retransmission error was corrected`
LogTemplate[4]: `external input interrupt (unit={unit} bit={bit}): {direction} retransmission error was corrected`

Logs:
Log[1]: `byte ordering exception(httpd).....................0`
Log[2]: `byte ordering exception(httpd).....................0`
Log[3]: `byte ordering exception(httpd).....................0`
Log[4]: `byte ordering exception(httpd).....................0`
Log[5]: `byte ordering exception(httpd).....................0`
Response:
<Inner monologue> All these logs have identical structure. They start with "byte ordering exception" followed by a process name in parentheses, then a series of dots and a number. The dynamic parts are the process name and the number, which I've parameterized as {process} and {number} respectively. </Inner monologue>
LogTemplate[1]: `byte ordering exception({process}).....................{number}`
LogTemplate[2]: `byte ordering exception({process}).....................{number}`
LogTemplate[3]: `byte ordering exception({process}).....................{number}`
LogTemplate[4]: `byte ordering exception({process}).....................{number}`
LogTemplate[5]: `byte ordering exception({process}).....................{number}`

- You must identify and extract all the dynamic variables in each log with {placeholder} and output static log templates.
- There are some similarities between logs that you can consider.
### Advices on parameters and non-parameters:
- Common dynamic parameter include: IP address, url, file path, integer, directory, hex, etc.
- Error messages or interrupted messages are NOT dynamic parameters since they contain importance information.

reflection = """
1. Basic Requirements
You will be given a set of log templates to analyze and update. Your task is to identify parameters within these templates, update them accordingly, and combine templates that should have the same value.
Your goal is to update all log templates, setting templates that should be combined to the same value. To accomplish this task, follow these guidelines:
2. Advices on parameters and non-parameters:
- Common dynamic parameter include: IP address, url, file path, integer, directory, hex, etc.
- Error messages or interrupted messages are NOT dynamic parameters since they contain importance information.
3. Updating and combining templates:
- If two or more templates are essentially the same after parameter replacement, combine them by using the same updated template for all of them.
3. Output format:
- Provide the updated log templates in the format: LogTemplate[idx]: `updated template`
- Ensure that templates that should be combined have exactly the same updated template
- Enclose each logTemplate in backticks.

Before providing your final answer, use the <scratchpad> tags to think through your process, identifying parameters, updating templates, and determining which templates should be combined.
Then, provide your final updated templates within <answer> tags.

Remember to carefully analyze each template, consider the context, and ensure consistency in your parameter replacements and template combinations.
